1. The game contains a Defense Points Counter at the top left
2. When the counter reaches 0, you get a Game Over screen
3. The counter goes down as viruses make it past you and disappear off the screen
4. Viruses spawn in ones every second, and then in pairs once you survive for 35 seconds, and in trios once you get to 70 seconds
5. Viruses spawn on the right side of the screen, and move left, where you are defending
5. Every 10.5 seconds, a powerup spawns, which could be either a health pack, a vaccine, or a speed boost
6. You need to collide with the powerup to get the powerup boost
6. The health pack increases your Defense Points by 5 and the speed boost increases your speed by 5
7. The first vaccine shot upgrades your character to level 1, and loads the image associated with that level
8. The second vaccine does the same, but with level 2, but also gives you the ability to shoot a lightning bolt. You can only have one lightning bolt on screen at a time, and it disappears upon hitting a virus
9. The third vaccine loads the image associated with level 3 for your character, and every vaccine after increases your Defense Points by 3
